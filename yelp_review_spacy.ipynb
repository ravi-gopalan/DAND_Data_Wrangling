The amount of room to watch the show is also pretty generous and it is often enough that you can come back or even wait around to catch the next round. It\\'s also free to watch and finding anything for free these days can be a challenge.\\n\\nThe only reason for the 4 instead of 5 is due to the fact that I had the opportunity to watch \"World of Color\" at Disneyland and that is THE MOST AMAZING water show in the world (of the 4 or 5 that I\\'ve seen anyway!).',\n",
              " \"Great place to stop in between gambling as the restaurant is located in MGM. The food was surprisingly really good as I understand that this is a chain restaurant. \\n\\nIt has a nice ambient feel to this place and the wait staff was attentive and helpful.   \\n\\nI ordered steak skewers as appetizer. The beef was tender and juicy. \\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered the chocolate soufflé because I saw a yelper post the dessert picture. My sugar addiction immediately  kicked in and said I've got to have one of these. The soufflé also came with a side order of ice cream. It definitely complimented the overall dessert taste. \\n\\nGreat place to dine in as well!\",\n",

I decided on a few toppings which all looked fresh, the staff was very helpful and great to talk to.  The pizza was done very quickly which is always a good look.  For me the pizza was just ok, nothing really stood out or was special about it.  Perhaps I'll give them another try at some point, but for now I'm just not getting the hype.\",\n",
              " \"We just bought an AMAZING car from Jim's Motors in Glendale, AZ and the whole experience was W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L !!!!!   This is what it must feel like to have a friend in the car business... \\n\\nAfter looking within--and nearby--our home city of Tucson for nearly a month, we still hadn't found the special car we wanted to purchase for Mom's Birthday.  Our standards were high and our requirements specific.  Mom likes the retro look, so it had to be a PT Cruiser or HHR.  For a birthday gift, it had to be beautiful and clean so it would be worthy of our wonderful Mom.  And since Mom is older (and not a mechanic), it HAD to have low miles, be in great shape, and clearly well taken care of.\\n\\nWith no luck in Tucson, we expanded our search to Phoenix and surrounding areas to see if we could meet our requirements and stay within our budget.  That's how we found Jim's Motors.  \\n\\nTheir website had photos of a beautifully customized White PT Cruiser with blue trim, the price was right and the specs were beyond wonderful!  With low mileage of 58,289, and an immaculate CarFax (provided at NO charge by Jim's Motors), we contacted them to check availability.  We received a response immediately from Sales Director Scott H. and booked an appt. to see it (since we had to drive 2 hours from Tucson to get there).  When we saw the PT Cruiser in person, it was everything claimed on their website and MORE!\\n\\nWe took the car for a test drive, and Scott was patient and gave us the opportunity to check things out mechanically to our satisfaction.  He was generous in answering our many questions, and very supportive in ensuring this gift was only in my Mom's name even though it took overnighting the paperwork to her for her signature (Mom's mostly had hand-me-down cars, and we wanted this vehicle to be special and only hers).  Scott even helped us look at different carriers qualified to get the car to Mom in Washington.  This beautiful, customized and obviously loved PT Cruiser arrived safely with Scott's guidance, and Mom is absolutely thrilled and ecstatic with her gift.\\n\\nIn summary, after this GREAT car-buying experience, even though we try to buy local for just about everything, we would not hesitate to START our next car search with Jim's Motors in Glendale, AZ (we only purchase used vehicles; never new).  Purchasing a used car has the potential to be very stressful, but it was absolutely well worth the half-day driving investment to have such a positive and pleasant buying experience.  \\n\\nWorking with Scott H. and Jim's Motors truly was like having a friend or family member in the car business.  I enthusiastically recommend them to anyone and everyone looking for a high-integrity dealership which offers exceptionally high-quality used vehicles and customer care with personal, no-pressure, professional service.  Thank you, Jim's Motors and Scott H.\",\n",

I order #10 combination noodles. It was light and delicious. My mouth was having a party with all the flavor from the fresh vegetables and the pork was ohhhh so good. I will come back and try the pho soup next time. This is a hidden gem in Gastonia.\",\n",

The service was excellent. My water was always refilled! We used the groupon, which was a great deal as it covered wine, dinner and flan for dessert. We even ordered extra dessert (chocolate mousse cake and the Nutella cheesecake) both were absolutely amazing. The meat was delicious and cooked to perfection. My favorite part was their garlic bread. Served in huge portions on skewers and it was amazing. \\nI am honestly surprised that people had a negative experience as ours was so wonderful. I would tell anyone to give it a shot, and I know my husband and I will be returning.\",\n",

It has an active bar and a sort of celebratory vibe, which made it nice for a birthday dinner.\\n\\nIt's vegetarian-friendly, and we've had some very interesting veggie and fish dishes in two visits. I particularly recommend the fish tacos--delicious and reasonably priced.\\n\\nOther favorites are halibut ceviche and gazpacho. All three dishes taste authentic--well, my version of that anyway. The tacos and ceviche would be right at home in CA. \\n\\nThe fish tacos are really the star though. The spicy creme fraiche sauce on the tacos was so tasty that we went home and tried to imitate it. The taco is a fresh wheat tortilla, an avocado slice, lightly battered fish, cole slaw dressed with lime, and a pink spicy creme fraiche sauce. It all works perfectly together. The acidity of the cole slaw is just perfect. I can't rave about these tacos enough (and I really love tacos).\\n\\nI also really like the homemade sweet potato chips.\\n\\nThey also have a good variety of wine, beer, and mixed drinks. The mojitos are very good.\\n\\nPortions are smallish, which I like. I was able to eat my appetizer and 2 of the 3 fish tacos. I really appreciate not having my plate loaded with rice and beans. More stuff I like, no stuff I don't.\\n\\nI suggest having reservations--we didn't the first time and we waited a while.\\n\\nThey also have a once a month prix fixe vegetarian dinner that we are going to try. It's pricey ($35, with $20 or so extra for wine pairing), but it's really hard to get high quality vegetarian food in a restaurant so we are going to try it.\\n\\nIncidentally, we liked the fish tacos so much that we made our own version at home (also delicious, but not as perfect). It's rare that a restaurant inspires me to directly copy one of their dishes.\"]"
