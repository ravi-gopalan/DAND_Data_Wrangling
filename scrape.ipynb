Wishing you all the best, Vikas\n",
            "23 August 20, 2019 abillionveg Hi Renee, Thanks for the review. We have been experimenting with categories in an effort to improve content moderation and the quality of reviews. We had a lot of categories and now we've gone in the other direction, and there's probably a happy medium that works for everyone. You can stop notifications in your app settings. All the best, Vikas\n",
            "24 May 27, 2019 abillionveg Dear Milica, thank you so much for your feedback and the great suggestions. We're going to think further about how we build this so its more responsive to what you need. Stay tuned for more improvements. We just released product reviews and there's lots of work to be done here over the next few months. Really appreciate your feedback, thank you.\n",
            "25 June 26, 2019 abillionveg Hi Chase, thank you for the review. This is spot on and very fair. Try using the filters in the near me map to select distance instead of popularity and you will see more results. And you can zoom out and zoom in on the map, but you have to zoom in enough to display results. You identified a lot of work in progress. Thanks for being part of this!\n",
            "26 May 30, 2019 abillionveg Thank you for the amazing feedback. We have been evaluating photo packages to find one that works really well for folders but so far haven't found one that works seamlessly. Regarding the grid, would you prefer 4 or 5 photos across? We've kept it at 3 so it works for smaller phones too. Thanks again for the detailed feedback, we appreciate it!\n",
            "27 July 15, 2019 abillionveg Hi Geoff, thanks so much for taking the time to write in. We're working through a couple of bugs that will improve latency and also there's a big revamp of the search function coming in August. Thanks for pointing out the delay with search results, it's something we're keenly focused on improving. Wishing you the best, Vikas\n",
            "28 October 22, 2019 abillionveg Dear Mikayla, Thank you so much for taking the time to post a review about the app. We're really grateful for your contributions in building the abillionveg movement and helping us get one step closer to making the impact that we all want. Wishing you all the best, Vikas\n",
            "29 October 22, 2019 abillionveg Dear friend, Thank you so much for our first review from Israel! We're grateful that you joined the community. One of my biggest frustrations in the app is the review function and our engineering team is working hard to improve the functionality and results of the search bar. You'll be seeing a big revamp and improvements before 2020! Best, Vikas\n",
            "30 June 12, 2019 abillionveg Thanks for your review! Definitely agree, we have a long way to go. Thanks for trying us out, hope we can make a bigger impact for you in the future. All the best.\n",

We're working hard to update the app and make it a great experience with more features and suggestions, and it's only going to happen thanks to the work of our members too. Wishing you all the best, Vikas\n",
            "32 July 25, 2019 abillionveg Hi Ray, thanks for taking the time to post a review. If you're not seeing any options its because nobody has posted a review yet. We have 40k reviews in 86 countries but it takes time to build an authentic community from the ground up. I hope you'll try us out again in 6 months and see a lot more! And if you're up for it, try posting a few reviews!\n",

            "42 July 29, 2019 abillionveg Dear Ren, thanks for taking the time to review the app. We're building an authentic new community and while we already have tons of reviews in 90 countries, there are lots of places where a review hasn't been posted yet. We hope you'll try adding the first review of a vegan option in your area. Thank you & all the best.\n",

Thanks for the feedback! Best, Vikas\n",

            "52 December 3, 2018 abillionveg Hi Trina, thanks for the great feedback. It's a constant process improving the functionality of the platform.

Please give us a shot and we'll get this right! Thanks and all the best Trina!\n",

            "1 Jared Thresher October 25, 2019  Loving the concept of this app. Even without the donations it's still a great idea. However that is a major incentive. What that said almost everything works pretty well however when you take a photo it comes out sideways and that's aggravating cuz you can't rotate it or anything. But other than that I'm loving this app and I just donated for the second time!\n",
            "2 abillionveg October 29, 2019  Been using this app for a while now.Apart from looking for reviews of restaurants and dishes, the app also provides products which are vegan(which is new) comparing the apps I have used previously.The best thing about this app is it gives me a chance to do something good for the animals. A very noble concept, which has made me love this app more and more.\n",
            "3 Shweta Ramanujam October 14, 2019  Overall considered not bad, it is good that having an app to help a vegan / vegetarian on searching vegan food nearby or somewhere. The review function also make me easier on my decision / preferred options. The most i like is the writing a review = making a donation. Only that the problem I found hard to upload my images as it doesn't allow me select from the categories of my gallery. Sometime i will post late, which I have to scroll all the way down just to look for my pictures.\n",
            "4 abillionveg October 22, 2019  Love this app especially because it allows users to make donations to animal welfare organizations and animal sanctuaries all over the world, which is something i have never seen before in any other review platforms! They also have articles in the app which cover a decent range of topics such as recipes, vegan food travel guides and even university vegan food guide :D Great job!\n",
            "5 Yoga Ong October 8, 2019 I like the idea! I think it's a little hard to use to find restaurants... When searching, dont just find any reviews in a certain area, just list the closest possible. Almost no one would search by dish, but by area/location. For a good idea check out happy cow's app \n",
            "6 abillionveg October 22, 2019 I really love this app. Very easy to use, great to see items purchased by others that I haven't tried before. Best part, it donates money to a farm sanctuary of my choice. \n",
            "7 eclipse9871 October 16, 2019 Fantastic app. Great resource which is useful to find vegan food and also incentivses people to contribute in order to garner donations to charity. The poke option is also a brilliant idea to get businesses to do more to be vegan friendly. \n",
            "8 abillionveg October 22, 2019  If you're finding it hard to dine out with friends who may not be vegan, feel that it's impossible to go vegan or just constantly posting food photos on Instagram and feel hollow after, this is the app you need. Every review raises 1 USD which you later can donate to a sanctuary/animal welfare organisation of your choice! How awesome is that?\n",
            "9 Jay Laone August 20, 2019 Love how this app binds people of same beliefs, and also a platform for anyone who is interested to join the vegan lifestyle! It has many good reviews on food and products, great sharing platform! \n",
            "10 abillionveg August 21, 2019 A great app with a great mission. I've donated over $200 to animal sanctuaries by just reviewing food through this app. A great way to help the animals and spread the message about good vegan food! \n",
            "11 Theresa Salchert October 16, 2019 Love the concept of this app. Easy to use and to upload new restaurants! Like having reviews of vegan food and products in the one place 😊 \n",
            "12 abillionveg October 22, 2019 A little complicated to start with, but comprehensive and worthwhile learning your way around. Excited to see the app transform \n",
            "13 Jonny Marshall October 6, 2019 Very easy to use and full of great info. I love this app because you are able to make a difference for an amazing cause! \n",
            "14 abillionveg October 22, 2019 It's a useful app. We can share our reviews, exchange useful information and make donation to help animals. I love the app! Thanks to abillionveg! \n",
            "15 Hazel Sim October 16, 2019 Great app 👍 it's different from Happy Cow because it's more about specific dishes you can order at restaurants and products from the grocery store whereas Happy Cow is more for travelling and restaurant reviews. \n",
            "16 abillionveg October 22, 2019 Love this app! Very easy to use and very helpful. I would add options in the settings, but it's a great app \n",
            "17 Lee Sheng Chua September 16, 2019 LOVE this app so much! So many good causes to receive donations and learning of so many products and restaurants! 10/10 \n",
            "18 abillionveg September 17, 2019 Excellent app! I love that I can help raise funds for animal advocacy non-profit organizations and sanctuaries ❤👍 \n",
            "19 Joy Rose September 26, 2019 Great app that encourages me to eat more vegan food so that I can review it 😆 gives 10USD donations to animal charities of your choice for every 10 reviews! \n",
            "20 abillionveg October 22, 2019 Easy to use. Great for reviewing vegan products and also looking up other's reviews \n",
            "21 Libby Wongstein October 5, 2019 Unfortunately it does not have a more up to date listing of the vegan restaurants in my area. There are at least a handful that I know of already. Oh well hopefully this app will improve soon. Sorry will have to uninstall for now. :-( \n",
            "22 abillionveg October 22, 2019 Clicked \"sign up\" and nothing happened. Tried to open the app later and it kept crashing whenever I tried. \n",
            "23 Alex Helme September 25, 2019 It's super useful for you and you get to help amazing organizations all in one! \n",
            "24 abillionveg October 22, 2019  Desperately needs more subcategories!! How is there no place for Candy? whose pantry only consists of instant noodles and mayo? (not mentioning that mayo is a refrigerated product). I had to add custard powder and drinking chocolate under the milyk category and sugar candy under chocolate, becauae there is absolutely no other spots for them. Not only does it make it hard for reveiwers but also for people who are looking for particular products by category. Needs a way to stop notifications also.\n",
            "25 Cynthia Villegas October 5, 2019  I love the idea! I think this app has great potential, I just have a few things I would like to change: I would like the option to edit a certain product, specifically with the categories. When adding a product I put it in a certain category, then later I realized that a different category would suit it better. Also when adding a new brand, I would like to be able to select multiple categories since there are some cosmetic brands that also make food.\n",
            "26 abillionveg October 22, 2019  vegan on pixel 3 the search mechanic is clunky right now and you have to just hit search over and over because the app always zooms in and displays a small area of results making you scroll and search enough to make it irritable. I do hope this is fixed soon and you can zoom out and search because I love the idea and how they donate when you do reviews which I will do. app is better suited to finding food as you are out and about not planning ahead (as of funcionality right now)\n",
            "27 caiyun Xu October 31, 2019  Love the idea of posting & promoting vegan foods around the world. Although, some complications detected. When I want to upload an image which was clicked long back, I have to endlessly keep scrolling through the gallery and there's no 'folder' options to select the images from, which will make it easier and user-friendly. Also, the gallery doesn't scroll smoothly as well, it only loads as 3 row grids, making me scroll too much. Please look into this. TIA.\n",
            "28 marisa b October 7, 2019  Great idea, but the app has some big problems. Often it blocks completely for a while, then suddenly wakes up and maniacally reacts to all the taps you made while it was thinking. And sometimes I cannot post a review for a restaurant the app does not know about already; it just says \"fetching more results\" forever...\n",
            "29 abillionveg October 22, 2019 Incredible app and love that I can support my favourite farm animal sanctuaries \n",
            "30 Candy Daitch October 11, 2019 They are doing great things. But they should improve the search function ☺️ \n",
            "31 abillionveg October 22, 2019  Has a long way to go. These apps seem to be all the rage lately, but I am yet to see one that comes remotely close to happycow. Hopefully the increase in apps directly correlates to an increase in vegansism. abillionveg does not currently appear to be of much use in Australia due to a lack of obvious listings, while random businesses are listed as 'very veg friendly'. Hopefully the data improves soon.\n",
            "32 Marinette Coertzen October 1, 2019 Love this app. It's essentially social media for vegans. \n",
            "33 abillionveg October 22, 2019 yikes . this is a horribly designed app. i was so excited because the idea is great but there is barely anything listed in the entirety of new england ?? cmon . the map feature is also nearly impossible to use and you cant narrow your search down to specific states. \n",
            "34 Melanie Martina September 18, 2019 Love the app and the suggestions and review it has 0 \n",
            "35 abillionveg September 23, 2019 Loving this much-needed app! So great for new vegans to help them find info about restaurants and products! well done! \n",
            "36 Crystal H October 23, 2019 It's and amazing and beautiful idea, love it! \n",
            "37 abillionveg October 29, 2019 love all the ideas. very nice community. very small and fresh to the market app. would love to see where it goes!! \n",
            "38 Riante du Toit September 16, 2019 I love this app!! I can find vegan options near me, it's so helpful and user friendly:) Thanks abillionveg!!! \n",
            "39 abillionveg September 17, 2019 can't open this app its keeps crashing and when it doesn't crash it freezes on sign up screen 😓 \n",
