Inside the bun it comes with tomato, onions, pickles and lettuce, basically what you expect from a burger. Currently burger joint is only offering the Portobello mushroom burger as their only choice of vegetarian option but I spoke to Darius, the manager who said that they will be sampling more vegetarian options in the coming weeks. I asked why they are bringing in more vegetarian options is because there is a increase demand for vegetarian dishes. \n",

            "Waiting time for the he Portobello burger was about 10 minutes and it came In a paper bag and it was well wrapped inside. When you unwrap the burger, you can just imagine how huge the burger is and it can barely fit into your mouth. \n",

It tasted to fresh and juicy and you just want to have more and more. As for the Portobello mushroom, it was just a patty coming along for the ride. There was a mild taste of Portobello but nothing wow to get you off your seat. It probably isn’t the best burger I’ve tasted but it’s good enough to be one of the better vegetarian burgers I’ve tasted. There is a big con against this joint. It is that the Portobello mushroom jalapeno burger with no sides cost around $17. It is certainly on the pricey side mainly due to the overall freshness and quality of the food. {'entities': [(0, 6, 'dish'), (36, 48, 'dish'), (61, 71, 'lifestyle'), (72, 80, 'vegetable'), (127, 139, 'dish'), (171, 179, 'vegetable'), (180, 185, 'dish'), (186, 198, 'dish'), (226, 236, 'lifestyle'), (257, 267, 'vegetable'), (268, 283, 'dish'), (307, 315, 'vegetable'), (328, 331, 'dish'), (346, 352, 'fruit'), (354, 360, 'vegetable'), (362, 369, 'condiment'), (374, 381, 'vegetable'), (416, 422, 'dish'), (434, 440, 'dish'), (468, 478, 'vegetable'), (479, 494, 'dish'), (519, 529, 'lifestyle'), (613, 623, 'lifestyle'), (646, 651, 'DATE'), (691, 701, 'lifestyle'), (752, 762, 'lifestyle'), (797, 814, 'dish'), (915, 921, 'dish'), (957, 963, 'dish'), (1012, 1017, 'ORDINAL'), (1053, 1059, 'dish'), (1065, 1072, 'vegetable'), (1074, 1082, 'fruit'), (1084, 1091, 'condiment'), (1093, 1099, 'vegetable'), (1104, 1113, 'vegetableU_spice'), (1246, 1265, 'vegetable'), (1281, 1286, 'dish'), (1340, 1350, 'vegetable'), (1420, 1426, 'dish'), (1484, 1494, 'lifestyle'), (1495, 1502, 'dish'), (1570, 1589, 'vegetable'), (1590, 1598, 'vegetable'), (1599, 1605, 'dish')]}\n",

Perhaps it was the anticipation of sinking my teeth into a mouthful of flavoured rice and beans but I was so excited as I cut the burrito open. The rice fell out almost immediately and exposed the rest of ingredients inside; salsa, peppers and onions. I chowed down and was rewarded with the fragrance from the ingredients. The wrap was nicely toasted and I really liked the texture as I chewed on it. However, my initial positive impression of the rice was not rewarded accordingly.

            "Imagine my delight when the dishes came. To be honest, I was a little disappointed when I noted the serving size of the paneer tikka masala. The garlic naan however came in two large pieces and I was so eager to get my hands onto those. I tasted the paneer tikka masala and to my delight, the spices of the curry really came together so well. The cottage cheese came in huge chunks in the curry, and the entire dish tasted excellent. I stirred my spoon around the curry and found pieces of vegetable, which really made the entire dish feel like I was eating a very fragrant stew. If I could make any improvements, I would have preferred a slightly spicier curry, but this dish was really fragrant and it was a delicious experience. This raised my expectations for the garlic naan which I greedily tore into pieces. I dipped my first piece and ate it with the curry (which was excellent) but when I ate the second piece by itself, I fell back disappointed. I was not an expert with naans, but it     was burned, and not just at the extent of being slightly charred. I could detect a bitter aftertaste and the naan just tasted bad. I tried parts of it which were less burnt, and it was actually not too bad; I could taste the garlic in it. However the naan was a little too buttery and oily; adding on to the burnt parts of it and I could not bring myself to finish the dish. {'entities': [(120, 139, 'dish'), (145, 156, 'bread'), (173, 176, 'CARDINAL'), (250, 269, 'dish'), (307, 312, 'dish'), (347, 361, 'dish'), (389, 394, 'dish'), (464, 469, 'dish'), (490, 499, 'vegetable'), (574, 578, 'dish'), (656, 661, 'dish'), (768, 779, 'bread'), (827, 832, 'ORDINAL'), (859, 864, 'dish'), (906, 912, 'ORDINAL'), (1108, 1112, 'bread'), (1224, 1230, 'spice'), (1250, 1254, 'bread')]}\n",

The bed of white rice that lay beneath the vegetables looked fresh and bursting with flavour.

The claypot meant that the rice bits stuck to the side of the claypot were typically charred and had a nice roasted smell to it. However the rest of the rice were not as soft as I would have preferred my rice. The plus point for the dish was that as expected, the freshness of the vegetables really helped to enhance the fragrance and the smell of the bimbimbap. However, and this could actually be down to a ‘plus point’, but SBCD’s proud declaration of no MSG in their dishes also meant that the dish tasted rather bland as a whole. I felt that the bimbimbap did not have a strong a flavour as one would expect from most Korean dishes. As mentioned, the texture of the dish was also ordinary and the sole plus point would come from the fragrance from the vegetables. The soup was also cold, and tasted bland and plain. However, the steamed egg turned out to be rather tasty.

I poked my acai bowl with my spoon and made contact with the delightful texture of the acai puree that was underneath the toppings. The rich colour of the puree made it look too good to eat. I tried the puree and was immensely amazed at how the texture of the puree was identical to that of ice cream. I was not sure if the recipe of the puree included other ingredients, but the puree tasted sweet with a slight tart-y taste, just like what you would expect from a berry. The puree went well with the toppings on my Signature Bowl. Nothing too special about the toppings, although I personally felt that a crunchy option; like the granola I had was an awesome contrast to the soft acai puree. For the same reason, I could not resist but ‘steal’ spoonfuls from my colleague’s Brazilian Bowl (she had granola WITH honey!). The added honey made the entire spoonful of acai such an amazing experience, as the smooth sweetness of honey wrapped itself around the blend of the granola and acai puree. {'entities': [(18, 32, 'dish'), (65, 79, 'dish'), (92, 96, 'dish'), (168, 172, 'dish'), (372, 381, 'dish'), (547, 552, 'fruit'), (598, 612, 'dish'), (713, 720, 'dish'), (763, 767, 'dish'), (857, 871, 'dish'), (881, 888, 'dish'), (894, 899, 'condiment'), (913, 918, 'condiment'), (947, 951, 'dish'), (1007, 1012, 'condiment'), (1052, 1059, 'dish'), (1064, 1068, 'dish')]}\n",

Rendang is a Malay dish which involved simmering meat, often beef in coconut milk and is served in a manner similar to curry, albeit a thicker version. The oily nature of the dish is not one of that I enjoy, although I really like the flavour and the fragrance brought out from the spices used in the dish. Using shiitake mushrooms to replace the meat may seem weird to many, but Whole Earth got it right with this dish. The blander nature of the mushrooms only served to elevate and bring out the fragrance of the stew-like nature of the dish, and the dish did not feel as ‘heavy’ or unhealthy as the original version. In fact, I liked the dish a lot and it was an excellent dish on its own. The dish is a little on the savoury side, so do take note to pair each bite with rice as it is too salty to eat on its own. {'entities': [(12, 26, 'dish'), (91, 98, 'dish'), (135, 142, 'dish'), (148, 153, 'NORP'), (184, 188, 'dish'), (196, 200, 'dish'), (204, 216, 'beverage'), (254, 259, 'dish'), (448, 466, 'vegetable'), (482, 486, 'dish'), (515, 526, 'ORG'), (582, 591, 'vegetable'), (650, 654, 'dish'), (909, 913, 'dish')]}\n",

I love when I visit Chinese restaurants with friends that are non-veg and they end up saying that my vegan dishes were the best thing! Just need to figure out something vegan that's better than duck at these places... But these noodles were definitely a hit at our table. The sesame seeds and veggies were perfect and for one of the less expensive dishes on the menu this was a huge portion that could feed 4.

            "As a vegan, I rarely get the chance to indulge in quesadillas, a dish that is defined by cheese--after all, “quesadilla” comes from “queso”, the Spanish word for cheese. I often hear that it is impossible to veganize a quesadilla, and many of the vegan versions I’ve come across so far just haven’t cut it. I was pleasantly surprised by the Hard Rock Cafe’s take on this classic Mexican dish, and the way they were able to craft a veganized version with the same delicious and creamy texture as cheese. The quesadilla had all the qualities that it needed: a tortilla grilled to a toasty golden crunch, and a generous and balanced spread of fillings. Although the quesadilla looked similar to many of the quesadillas I had tried in the past, the first taste brought flavors that I had not expected from this classic Mexican dish. The olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and spinach formed a satisfying combination that was reminiscent of breezy summers in Italy or Greece, and the cool herb hummus brought balance to the golden tortillas. After sharing the dish around the table, it quickly became a hit all around, and one that I would order again during my next visit. The portion size was a bit small, and I’ll keep this in mind in the future, especially if sharing the dish! After enjoying the quesadillas, the salad was a refreshing closer to this healthy and delicious meal. {'entities': [(5, 10, 'lifestyle'), (50, 61, 'dish'), (89, 95, 'dish'), (109, 119, 'dish'), (145, 152, 'NORP'), (162, 168, 'dish'), (219, 229, 'dish'), (247, 252, 'lifestyle'), (379, 386, 'NORP'), (495, 501, 'dish'), (507, 517, 'dish'), (558, 566, 'bread'), (663, 673, 'dish'), (704, 715, 'dish'), (745, 750, 'ORDINAL'), (815, 822, 'NORP'), (833, 842, 'condiment'), (844, 861, 'fruit'), (867, 874, 'vegetable'), (949, 954, 'GPE'), (984, 990, 'dish'), (1021, 1030, 'dish'), (1291, 1302, 'dish'), (1308, 1313, 'dish')]}\n",

            "As a classic burger cafe, I was excited to hear that Hard Rock had two vegetarian burger offerings on their menu, and opted for the vegan Chickpea patty. Although the yogurt sauce and bread were not vegan (each bun had an egg-white glazing), the patty and other toppings still made for a satisfying meal. I’ve tried a number of chickpea patties in the past, but this one had more texture and flavor than any of the others I’ve tried. The house-made combination of chickpeas with red skin potato, spinach, chili peppers, cilantro, and spices gave the burger a hearty character, and the greens added color and reminded me that the meal was a healthy choice. On the outside of the burger was a crispy layer that was grilled to a golden brown, and I enjoyed having the slightly different textures in the patty. As you’d expect from a restaurant like the Hard Rock, the fries were killer (always a good vegan option), and made for a great combination with the burger. In the future, I would love to see the Hard Rock add vegan buns to their burger selection. {'entities': [(13, 19, 'dish'), (53, 62, 'ORG'), (67, 70, 'CARDINAL'), (71, 81, 'lifestyle'), (82, 88, 'dish'), (132, 137, 'lifestyle'), (138, 146, 'vegetable'), (147, 152, 'dish'), (167, 179, 'condiment'), (184, 189, 'bread'), (199, 204, 'lifestyle'), (211, 214, 'dish'), (222, 225, 'dish'), (246, 251, 'dish'), (328, 336, 'vegetable'), (337, 344, 'dish'), (464, 473, 'vegetable'), (488, 494, 'vegetable'), (496, 503, 'vegetable'), (505, 518, 'fruit'), (520, 528, 'herb'), (550, 556, 'dish'), (585, 591, 'vegetable'), (678, 684, 'dish'), (800, 805, 'dish'), (850, 859, 'ORG'), (865, 870, 'dish'), (898, 903, 'lifestyle'), (955, 961, 'dish'), (1002, 1011, 'ORG'), (1016, 1021, 'lifestyle'), (1022, 1026, 'dish'), (1036, 1042, 'dish')]}\n",

            "It was great to see the Hard Rock adding a vegetarian option for fajitas on their main menu, and after asking our waiter about a vegan version, he was happy to accommodate. The house-made guacamole was fantastic, and with two generous scoops, its fresh and lemony taste really added a lot to the fajitas as a whole. Accompanying the veggies was an excellent pico de gallo and some warmed tortillas, which formed a great packaging for the vegetable fillings. While the texture and variety of the veggies was great, they would have been even better with more spices and flavor. I also feel that fajitas are best with ample onions and peppers, and would love to see a spread that brings out those more, but that might also just be personal preference. Overall, the fajitas are a decent vegetarian/vegan option, and were filling, delicious, and very healthy.

There were bits of the ingredients in the soup which was a big win for me; it adds to the chunky texture of the soup and made me relish each spoonful so much more. I thought the soup was of the perfect texture; there isn't the overly thick texture you may get with canned soup, nor is it like the poor thin cousins that you may find with poorly brewed soup. The soup tasted fantastic, and was really helped to kickstart my appetite. The soup was served with a slice of sour dough bread but hey, I want all the soup for myself so nope, I chose to eat the bread by itself without utilizing the delicious soup as a dip.

It sounded inconceivable until I tried it for the first time and my life was changed forever. I am not kidding. It is as its name suggests - mango sticky rice reborn in ice cream form. It's amazing.

I would gladly pay a premium to be able to buy a scoop at anytime throughout the year though. Perhaps it's this mystical, ULTRA-RARE element that lends to the overall appeal of the dish.

Soup Curry usually does not contain milk (even coconut milk), making it lighter compared to other types of Curry. This curry usually is filed with lots of roasted vegetables like carrots, potatoes, burdock, lotus roots, cabbage, pumpkin etc or whatever is in season, and add the meat of your choice, usually chicken. But all Soup curry restaurants will have a vegetarian version. You can choose the spiciness, and the rice is served on the side.

If you are a Vegan traveler in Vietnam looking to try local coffee, be sure you know how the beans were roasted or find coffee shops that roast their own beans and can explain the roasting process. {'entities': [(53, 70, 'beverage'), (103, 120, 'beverage'), (128, 133, 'lifestyle'), (179, 184, 'food_habit'), (224, 244, 'PRODUCT'), (277, 283, 'condiment'), (345, 350, 'vegetable'), (365, 370, 'lifestyle'), (383, 390, 'GPE'), (412, 418, 'beverage'), (445, 450, 'vegetable'), (472, 478, 'beverage'), (490, 495, 'dish'), (506, 511, 'vegetable')]}\n",

The kitchen was very helpful in veganizing our usual order, adding tomatoes, basil, carmelized onions,  peppers and what looked like Daiya vegan cheese. Every part of the pie tasted as I had hoped it would except for the cheese, which had a slightly rubbery texture. Although the pizza didn't meet my expectations, I would still recommend Bill's to vegans looking for their pizza fix, as their crust, ingredient quality, and service is great! {'entities': [(95, 100, 'lifestyle'), (101, 106, 'dish'), (175, 183, 'fruit'), (185, 190, 'herb'), (203, 209, 'vegetable'), (212, 219, 'condiment'), (241, 259, 'dish'), (329, 335, 'dish'), (388, 393, 'dish'), (457, 463, 'lifestyle'), (482, 487, 'dish')]}\n",

I decided to try out their breakfast for the first time after many burger visits, and was not disappointed! The portion was more than plenty, and the tofu scramble had great flavor.

They have agave sweetened soda fountains along with sugar-cane soda fountains, and a great selection of different fresh lemonades and iced teas! So far I’ve been to their Portland and Bend, OR locations, and I always leave satisfied. The only bad thing I have to say is that they could very much improve their french fries game!

Inside the bun it comes with tomato, onions, pickles and lettuce, basically what you expect from a burger. Currently burger joint is only offering the Portobello mushroom burger as their only choice of vegetarian option but I spoke to Darius, the manager who said that they will be sampling more vegetarian options in the coming weeks. I asked why they are bringing in more vegetarian options is because there is a increase demand for vegetarian dishes. \n",

It tasted to fresh and juicy and you just want to have more and more. As for the Portobello mushroom, it was just a patty coming along for the ride. There was a mild taste of Portobello but nothing wow to get you off your seat. It probably isn’t the best burger I’ve tasted but it’s good enough to be one of the better vegetarian burgers I’ve tasted. There is a big con against this joint. It is that the Portobello mushroom jalapeno burger with no sides cost around $17. It is certainly on the pricey side mainly due to the overall freshness and quality of the food. {'entities': [(0, 6, 'dish'), (36, 48, 'dish'), (61, 71, 'lifestyle'), (72, 80, 'vegetable'), (127, 139, 'dish'), (171, 179, 'vegetable'), (180, 185, 'dish'), (186, 198, 'dish'), (226, 236, 'lifestyle'), (257, 267, 'vegetable'), (268, 283, 'dish'), (307, 315, 'vegetable'), (328, 331, 'dish'), (346, 352, 'fruit'), (354, 360, 'vegetable'), (362, 369, 'condiment'), (374, 381, 'vegetable'), (416, 422, 'dish'), (434, 440, 'dish'), (468, 478, 'vegetable'), (479, 494, 'dish'), (519, 529, 'lifestyle'), (613, 623, 'lifestyle'), (646, 651, 'DATE'), (691, 701, 'lifestyle'), (752, 762, 'lifestyle'), (797, 814, 'dish'), (915, 921, 'dish'), (957, 963, 'dish'), (1012, 1017, 'ORDINAL'), (1053, 1059, 'dish'), (1065, 1072, 'vegetable'), (1074, 1082, 'fruit'), (1084, 1091, 'condiment'), (1093, 1099, 'vegetable'), (1104, 1113, 'vegetableU_spice'), (1246, 1265, 'vegetable'), (1281, 1286, 'dish'), (1340, 1350, 'vegetable'), (1420, 1426, 'dish'), (1484, 1494, 'lifestyle'), (1495, 1502, 'dish'), (1570, 1589, 'vegetable'), (1590, 1598, 'vegetable'), (1599, 1605, 'dish')]}\n",

I tasted the paneer tikka masala and to my delight, the spices of the curry really came together so well. The cottage cheese came in huge chunks in the curry, and the entire dish tasted excellent. I stirred my spoon around the curry and found pieces of vegetable, which really made the entire dish feel like I was eating a very fragrant stew. If I could make any improvements, I would have preferred a slightly spicier curry, but this dish was really fragrant and it was a delicious experience. This raised my expectations for the garlic naan which I greedily tore into pieces. I dipped my first piece and ate it with the curry (which was excellent) but when I ate the second piece by itself, I fell back disappointed. I was not an expert with naans, but it     was burned, and not just at the extent of being slightly charred. I could detect a bitter aftertaste and the naan just tasted bad. I tried parts of it which were less burnt, and it was actually not too bad; I could taste the garlic in it. However the naan was a little too buttery and oily; adding on to the burnt parts of it and I could not bring myself to finish the dish. {'entities': [(120, 139, 'dish'), (145, 156, 'bread'), (173, 176, 'CARDINAL'), (250, 269, 'dish'), (307, 312, 'dish'), (347, 361, 'dish'), (389, 394, 'dish'), (464, 469, 'dish'), (490, 499, 'vegetable'), (574, 578, 'dish'), (656, 661, 'dish'), (768, 779, 'bread'), (827, 832, 'ORDINAL'), (859, 864, 'dish'), (906, 912, 'ORDINAL'), (1108, 1112, 'bread'), (1224, 1230, 'spice'), (1250, 1254, 'bread')]}\n",

There was the usual kimchi, a small plate of seaweed, a piece of fried fish, as well as spicy stir fried squid.

As mentioned, the mix of bright colours really appealed in the dish, and the claypot that held the food highlighted the aesthetics of the entire dish. The bed of white rice that lay beneath the vegetables looked fresh and bursting with flavour. The Sesame Soontofu however did not look as pleasing and the steamed egg that floated above the soup laid in pieces. Seaweed floated around limply in the soup bowl and the bowl just did not appeal to me.\n",

The claypot meant that the rice bits stuck to the side of the claypot were typically charred and had a nice roasted smell to it. However the rest of the rice were not as soft as I would have preferred my rice. The plus point for the dish was that as expected, the freshness of the vegetables really helped to enhance the fragrance and the smell of the bimbimbap. However, and this could actually be down to a ‘plus point’, but SBCD’s proud declaration of no MSG in their dishes also meant that the dish tasted rather bland as a whole. I felt that the bimbimbap did not have a strong a flavour as one would expect from most Korean dishes. As mentioned, the texture of the dish was also ordinary and the sole plus point would come from the fragrance from the vegetables. The soup was also cold, and tasted bland and plain. However, the steamed egg turned out to be rather tasty.

Rendang is a Malay dish which involved simmering meat, often beef in coconut milk and is served in a manner similar to curry, albeit a thicker version. The oily nature of the dish is not one of that I enjoy, although I really like the flavour and the fragrance brought out from the spices used in the dish. Using shiitake mushrooms to replace the meat may seem weird to many, but Whole Earth got it right with this dish. The blander nature of the mushrooms only served to elevate and bring out the fragrance of the stew-like nature of the dish, and the dish did not feel as ‘heavy’ or unhealthy as the original version. In fact, I liked the dish a lot and it was an excellent dish on its own. The dish is a little on the savoury side, so do take note to pair each bite with rice as it is too salty to eat on its own. {'entities': [(12, 26, 'dish'), (91, 98, 'dish'), (135, 142, 'dish'), (148, 153, 'NORP'), (184, 188, 'dish'), (196, 200, 'dish'), (204, 216, 'beverage'), (254, 259, 'dish'), (448, 466, 'vegetable'), (482, 486, 'dish'), (515, 526, 'ORG'), (582, 591, 'vegetable'), (650, 654, 'dish'), (909, 913, 'dish')]}\n",

Instead of using normally white coconut rice, Blue Bistro uses basmati rice as it is not only more fragrant than traditional rice, it also also proven to be healthier. The dish also came with mock meat rendang which was a stand out for the dish. It was so aromatic and delicious. You just want to keep eating more and more. Sambal chili was grated with coconut to give a sweet after taste. The mock “Ikan bilis” or anchovies we’re made from mushroom stalks. I am not a biggest fan of ladies fingers but then again it was so fresh and juicy it turned out to be so yummy.\n",

            "As a vegan, I rarely get the chance to indulge in quesadillas, a dish that is defined by cheese--after all, “quesadilla” comes from “queso”, the Spanish word for cheese. I often hear that it is impossible to veganize a quesadilla, and many of the vegan versions I’ve come across so far just haven’t cut it. I was pleasantly surprised by the Hard Rock Cafe’s take on this classic Mexican dish, and the way they were able to craft a veganized version with the same delicious and creamy texture as cheese. The quesadilla had all the qualities that it needed: a tortilla grilled to a toasty golden crunch, and a generous and balanced spread of fillings. Although the quesadilla looked similar to many of the quesadillas I had tried in the past, the first taste brought flavors that I had not expected from this classic Mexican dish. The olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and spinach formed a satisfying combination that was reminiscent of breezy summers in Italy or Greece, and the cool herb hummus brought balance to the golden tortillas. After sharing the dish around the table, it quickly became a hit all around, and one that I would order again during my next visit. The portion size was a bit small, and I’ll keep this in mind in the future, especially if sharing the dish! After enjoying the quesadillas, the salad was a refreshing closer to this healthy and delicious meal. {'entities': [(5, 10, 'lifestyle'), (50, 61, 'dish'), (89, 95, 'dish'), (109, 119, 'dish'), (145, 152, 'NORP'), (162, 168, 'dish'), (219, 229, 'dish'), (247, 252, 'lifestyle'), (379, 386, 'NORP'), (495, 501, 'dish'), (507, 517, 'dish'), (558, 566, 'bread'), (663, 673, 'dish'), (704, 715, 'dish'), (745, 750, 'ORDINAL'), (815, 822, 'NORP'), (833, 842, 'condiment'), (844, 861, 'fruit'), (867, 874, 'vegetable'), (949, 954, 'GPE'), (984, 990, 'dish'), (1021, 1030, 'dish'), (1291, 1302, 'dish'), (1308, 1313, 'dish')]}\n",

            "As a classic burger cafe, I was excited to hear that Hard Rock had two vegetarian burger offerings on their menu, and opted for the vegan Chickpea patty. Although the yogurt sauce and bread were not vegan (each bun had an egg-white glazing), the patty and other toppings still made for a satisfying meal. I’ve tried a number of chickpea patties in the past, but this one had more texture and flavor than any of the others I’ve tried. The house-made combination of chickpeas with red skin potato, spinach, chili peppers, cilantro, and spices gave the burger a hearty character, and the greens added color and reminded me that the meal was a healthy choice. On the outside of the burger was a crispy layer that was grilled to a golden brown, and I enjoyed having the slightly different textures in the patty. As you’d expect from a restaurant like the Hard Rock, the fries were killer (always a good vegan option), and made for a great combination with the burger. In the future, I would love to see the Hard Rock add vegan buns to their burger selection. {'entities': [(13, 19, 'dish'), (53, 62, 'ORG'), (67, 70, 'CARDINAL'), (71, 81, 'lifestyle'), (82, 88, 'dish'), (132, 137, 'lifestyle'), (138, 146, 'vegetable'), (147, 152, 'dish'), (167, 179, 'condiment'), (184, 189, 'bread'), (199, 204, 'lifestyle'), (211, 214, 'dish'), (222, 225, 'dish'), (246, 251, 'dish'), (328, 336, 'vegetable'), (337, 344, 'dish'), (464, 473, 'vegetable'), (488, 494, 'vegetable'), (496, 503, 'vegetable'), (505, 518, 'fruit'), (520, 528, 'herb'), (550, 556, 'dish'), (585, 591, 'vegetable'), (678, 684, 'dish'), (800, 805, 'dish'), (850, 859, 'ORG'), (865, 870, 'dish'), (898, 903, 'lifestyle'), (955, 961, 'dish'), (1002, 1011, 'ORG'), (1016, 1021, 'lifestyle'), (1022, 1026, 'dish'), (1036, 1042, 'dish')]}\n",

The house-made guacamole was fantastic, and with two generous scoops, its fresh and lemony taste really added a lot to the fajitas as a whole. Accompanying the veggies was an excellent pico de gallo and some warmed tortillas, which formed a great packaging for the vegetable fillings. While the texture and variety of the veggies was great, they would have been even better with more spices and flavor. I also feel that fajitas are best with ample onions and peppers, and would love to see a spread that brings out those more, but that might also just be personal preference.

My non-veg friends at the table loved the mushrooms and said they'd be a great alternative to some of the non-veg food they had ordered.

Veganburg told us that it was a in house recipe, made with 12 nutrition-packed ingredients (corn, onion, potatoes, kidney beans, chopped tomatoes, celery, and mixed vegetable cubes); and well I took their word for it! There were bits of the ingredients in the soup which was a big win for me; it adds to the chunky texture of the soup and made me relish each spoonful so much more. I thought the soup was of the perfect texture; there isn't the overly thick texture you may get with canned soup, nor is it like the poor thin cousins that you may find with poorly brewed soup. The soup tasted fantastic, and was really helped to kickstart my appetite. The soup was served with a slice of sour dough bread but hey, I want all the soup for myself so nope, I chose to eat the bread by itself without utilizing the delicious soup as a dip.

Light, flavourful, with a Asian twist. {'entities': [(24, 29, 'dish'), (39, 45, 'GPE'), (49, 56, 'NORP'), (75, 83, 'NORP'), (87, 94, 'GPE'), (169, 175, 'dish'), (180, 188, 'NORP'), (195, 200, 'dish'), (267, 277, 'vegetable'), (284, 291, 'condiment'), (308, 318, 'NORP'), (342, 347, 'dish'), (419, 429, 'lifestyle'), (457, 462, 'NORP')]}\n",

I am mostly dairy free but occasionally I allow myself to indulge a little bit of cheese. All cheese at 4P are homemade and they have an impressive cheeseboard. I decided to go for a small indulgence and shared a burrata. Fresh, creamy, nicely done. The salad is very fresh. The dish is simple, nothing fancy but taste great.

Fine print is serious about their Avo Toast as they have it in 3 ways, and even one which is called half and half if you can’t decide. I am not going to disclose the others yet as I tend to try and review them all. Today’s choice is classic, creamy avocado with lemon, basil and sea salt, on a perfectly toasted sourdough toast, drizzled with olive oil and top with fresh greens. Paired with seriously the best coffee in Hong Kong, makes it a perfect breakfast. Instead of sourdough, you can choose bagel. For coffee they serve soy, almond and oat milk for non dairy eaters. By the way, they open at 6am.

            "Soup Curry is a specialty Curry in Sapporo, where the curry is cooked in broth like soup with lots of spices. Soup Curry usually does not contain milk (even coconut milk), making it lighter compared to other types of Curry. This curry usually is filed with lots of roasted vegetables like carrots, potatoes, burdock, lotus roots, cabbage, pumpkin etc or whatever is in season, and add the meat of your choice, usually chicken. But all Soup curry restaurants will have a vegetarian version. You can choose the spiciness, and the rice is served on the side. The way to eat soup Curry is to mix the rice into the broth instead of the other way.

They have delicious salad dressings to choose from including a vegan ranch and vegan thousand island. Their weekend brunch is also very good and there is rarely a wait like so many other places in Portland. My favorite breakfast plate there is called The Portland, it’s a tofu scramble with veggies and potatoes and a biscuit or toast of choice.
